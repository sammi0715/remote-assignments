Week 3
  Assignment 1: Your First Web Server
    To build your first web server for development, follow the steps below:
    Install Node.js
    Create a Node.js project by npm
    Install Express module in your Node.js project by npm
    Write a simple web server program and start it
    Show an HTML page when you enter http://localhost:3000/ in a browser’s address bar (For example: a simple page including “Hello, My Server!” is an acceptable result.)
    
  Assignment 2: Build Backend API for Front-End
    1.When a user enters http://localhost:3000/getData in a browser’s address bar, show the "Lack of Parameter" message in the page.
    2.When a user enters some url like http://localhost:3000/getData?number=xyz in a browser’s address bar, show the "Wrong Parameter" message in the page.
    3.When a user enters http://localhost:3000/getData?number=5, they should get the result of 1+2+....+5 in the page.
    4.Generally speaking, when a user enters http://localhost:3000/getData?number=POSITIVE_INTEGER, they can get the result of 1+2+....+ POSITIVE_INTEGER in the page.

  Assignment 3: Connect to Backend API by AJAX
    1.Update your Express project to serve static files. You can refer to this document.
    2.Serve a static HTML file named sum.html. It means you can enter http://localhost:3000/sum.html in a browser’s address bar to get this HTML page.
    3.Write a simple user interface (a text input and a button) and some JavaScript code in sum.html to let users enter a number and make an HTTP request by AJAX to the 
      API implemented in assignment 2, and show the result from the server.
    For example:
    show "Lack of Parameter" when a user enters nothing
    show "Wrong Parameter" when a user enters "xyz"
    show "55" when a user enters "10"
    
  Assignment 4: Deploy Web Server (Advanced Optional)
  You have built your first local web server. If you want to make the web server accessible from the internet, you need to deploy the web.
